# GMGlobules
Game Maker framework for basic VN-esque needs


I needed a name for little nodes that contribute to a greater whole!
This code was originally written for the Thrown Controllers panel development, but I wanted to utilize my work for other projects more easily, without being tied down to specific proprietary work.
However, this code does expect to be used alongside (https://github.com/JujuAdams/Scribble)[Scribble], as it's a fantastic library anyway and worth your time to use, but the new code is specifically written around it.

The (https://github.com/WishMakers0/GMGlobules/releases)[releases page] provides builds for you in `.yymps` format, which can be imported in GameMaker:Studio 2 itself.
